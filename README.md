# Iris Plant Classification
Iris is a flowering plant genus of 310 accepted species with showy flowers. As well as being the scientific name, iris is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species, as well as some belonging to other closely related genera.

The Iris plant dataset was created by R.A. Fisher assisted by so many scientist. The Iris dataset has 150 rows and 5 columns with no missing values. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

**Attribute Information**:
   1) sepal length (in cm)
   2) sepal width (in cm)
   3) petal length (in cm)
   4) petal width (in cm)
   5) class:
      i) Iris Setosa
      ii) Iris Versicolour
      iii) Iris Virginica

The main aim of this project is to implement a Machine Learning Classification or Regression model on the dataset. EDA, Data Preprocessing, Model development, Model evaluation and Model Deployment were performed to better understand the data, to classify the data and evaluate the performance of the model.
Four models were build and were trained to classify the type of iris plant with respect to three features: **sepal length, sepal width** and **petal length**
